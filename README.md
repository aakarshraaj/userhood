# Userhood: Brand & Engineering Aligned

A technical studio aligning brand, product, and engineering for high-stakes ventures. We build scalable platforms where the aesthetic vision dictates the technical execution without compromising on speed or core architecture stability.

## Core Philosophy
We operate as systems engineers. Brand is the source code. Engineering is the execution layer.

> "Incredible engineering is useless if it's trapped behind a mediocre interface, and a beautiful interface is a liability if the code can't support it."

## Tech Stack
- React 19 + TypeScript
- Framer Motion (Animation logic & Micro-interactions)
- Tailwind CSS v4 (Custom terminal-style design system)
- Vite Ecosystem

Run the application locally:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
